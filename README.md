## ‚ú® Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ RFID-based Door Security
- Grants access only to authorized RFID tags.
- Unauthorized access triggers a buzzer alarm.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Automatic Water Tank Management
- Monitors water levels using sensors.
- Automatically starts the pump when the tank is empty and stops it when full.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ LPG Gas Leak Detection & Safety System
- Detects gas leakage in the kitchen.
- Automatically:
  - Cuts off kitchen power supply
  - Closes gas regulator
  - Activates buzzer alarm
  - Turns on exhaust fan
- Sends alerts via IoT Cloud.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Automatic Lighting System
- Detects ambient light and human presence.
- Turns lights on in darkness and off when not needed.
- Saves energy efficiently.

## üîå Working Principle
1. **Sensors** continuously monitor environmental conditions (water level, gas, light, motion).
2. **ESP32** processes sensor data and sends it to the **Arduino IoT Cloud**.
3. **User Interface**: Mobile app or web dashboard for remote control and monitoring.
4. **Automation Rules**: Based on sensor readings, devices are switched on/off automatically.
